### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 10 please :)

#### General Comments
- The application requests authorization to access service resources from the user
- If the user authorized the request, the application receives an authorization grant
- The application requests an access token from the authorization server (API) by presenting authentication of its own identity, and the authorization grant
- If the application identity is authenticated and the authorization grant is valid, the authorization server (API) issues an access token to the application. Authorization is complete.
- The application requests the resource from the resource server (API) and presents the access token for authentication
- If the access token is valid, the resource server (API) serves the resource to the application

#### Pros
* It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.

* It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.

#### Cons
* If you are adding more extension at the ends in the specification, it will produce a wide range of non-interoperable implementations, which means you have to write separate pieces of code for Facebook, Google, etc.
* If your favorite sites are connected to the central hub and the central account is hacked, then it will lead to serious effects across several sites instead of just one.

   - it provides a thin layer on top of Node.js with web application features such as basic routing, middleware, template engine and static files serving, so the drastic I/O performance of Node.js doesnâ€™t get compromised.  

4. Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it?  
    yes like GitHub
